# project-manager
Unfinished/slightly buggy project manager written in VB.Net using Forms. Allows user to create tasks and subtasks + add properties to individual tasks. Uses MySQL to save data in a locally hosted database. Encrypts and decrypts data in the database based on a user entered password.
